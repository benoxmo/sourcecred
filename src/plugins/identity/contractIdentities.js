 * This functionality is defined as part of the identity plugin rather than as
 * a feature of WeightedGraph because it doesn't attempt to contract weights
 * (it's not clear how to do this in a general principled way). Within the
 * identity plugin, we do not expect user identities to have weights
 * associated, so we can contract the graph without attempting to contract the
 * weights.
 *
 * As a safety measure, this method will error if any of the node addresses
 * being contracted has an explicitly set weight. It will not error if there
 * are matching type weights, so that it is still possible (e.g.) to apply
 * a weighting to an entire plugin.
 *
 * For more context on this decision, see discussion in #1591.
